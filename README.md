# 3DViewer_v1.0-1
3DViewer_v1.0 is a program for visualizing 3D wireframe models. With it, you can open .obj files and view 3D wireframe models.

The program provides the ability to:
• Load a wireframe model from an obj file (vertices and surfaces list support only).
• Translate the model by a given distance in relation to the X, Y, Z axes.
• Rotate the model by a given angle relative to its X, Y, Z axes.
• Scale the model by a given value.
• Configure projection type (parallel and central)
• Configure the type (solid, dotted), color and thickness of edges, display method (none, circle, square), color and size of vertices.
• Choose background color
• Save settings between program restarts.
